## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
User ──► BorrowerExample ──► MockFlashLoanProvider ──► MockERC20
                                      │
                                      ▼
                                  BadgeNFT (Achievement)
```

**Flow**: Borrow → Execute Strategy → Repay + Fee → Mint Badge
